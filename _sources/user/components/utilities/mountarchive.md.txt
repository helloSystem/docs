# mountarchive

The __`mountarchive`__ tool makes archives (like `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tar.bz2` accessible in the Filer without having to extract them.

For example, if you double-click a zip file called `plugin.video.invidious-0.5.3.zip` on your desktop, it will be mounted and a Filer window will be opened at its mountpoint, e.g., `/var/run/user/1001/_home_user_Desktop_plugin.video.invidious-0.5.3.zip`.
