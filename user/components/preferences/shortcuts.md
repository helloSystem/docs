# Shortcut Keys

The __Shortcut Keys__ preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts.


``` .. note::
    The left Ctrl and Alt keys are swapped in helloSystem by default to make shortcuts feel welcoming to switchers coming from the Mac.
```

A __shortcut__ is a key or key combination you can press to invoke a defined action on your computer. Shortcuts can be defined by applications (per-application shortcuts), or can affect the whole system (system-wide shortcuts).

``` .. note::
    The Shortcut Keys preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts only, not per-application shortcuts. Some applications contain similar functionality inside the respective application to view and edit per-application keyboard shortcuts.
```

## Default shortcuts

Open the __Shortcut Keys__ preferences application to view the default system-wide shortcuts.

Notable default shortcuts include:

* Press __<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>__ to __search in the Menu__ (e.g., to launch applications or to execute commands in the frontmost application)
* Press __Ctrl+Alt+Esc__ and click on an application window to __forcefully quit an application__ that is malfunctioning
* Press __Alt+Shift+3__ or the __PrtScn__ key on your keyboard to __take a screenshot__

This list is not exhaustive.
