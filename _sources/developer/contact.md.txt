## Discussions

The helloSystem [Discussions](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/discussions/) forum is a great place to interact with helloSystem users and developers. If you have questions, feel free to ask in "Q&A". If you are running helloSystem, we'd be happy to hear from you in the "Show and tell" section.

## Chat

You can also meet other helloSystem users and developers at [`#helloSystem:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#helloSystem:matrix.org) from any Matrix client (such as the Element web-based Matrix client). This Matrix channel is bridged to the IRC channel #helloSystem on  irc.libera.chat. Joining via Matrix has the advantage that you will see responses that you may have received while you were offline. So after asking a question, you can come back in a day or so to see if there were any responses.

In any case, _please stay in the channel for a few days_ and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers and come by only once in a while.
