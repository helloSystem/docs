# Getting started

## Status

hello is currently being developed. It is not yet available for general use, but advanced users can try out continuous builds of pre-alpha ISO images that can be booted from DVD or USB storage media.

## System requirements

* 2 GHz dual core Intel/ARM 64-bit processor
* 4 GiB RAM (system memory for physical and viritualized installs)
* VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution
* Either a CD/DVD drive or a USB port for booting the installer media

In the future, there may also be builds for other processor architectures. We would like to bring down the RAM requirement considerably.

### Tested hardware

hello is known to boot to a graphical desktop on the following machines. Auxiliary functionality such as wireless networking, sound over HDMI, sleep, graphics acceleration, etc. has not yet been tested systematically.

* Acer Revo RL85
* Dell Inc. OptiPlex 780

### Tested virtualization environments

* VirtualBox host (on FreeBSD)
* VMware host (on Windows)

## Downloading

Continuous builds of pre-alpha ISO images are available for download [here](https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases/tag/continuous-hello).

```eval_rst
important:: Images get built automatically whenever source code is committed. Not every build is tested.
