# Windows

helloSystem provides a graphical desktop experience that should be familiar to users of existing desktop operating systems.

## Traffic lights

Windows contain three buttons, called "traffic lights":

* __Red__: Click this button to close the window
* __Yellow__: Click this button to hide (minimize) the window. To make the window appear again, click on its icon in the Dock, or select "Unhide all" from the System menu
* __Green__: Click this button to make the window use the full screen real estate available (maximize). Click this button again to resize the window to its previous size

## Resizing windows

Place the mouse cursor in any edge of the window. The cursor will change. Click and drag the mouse to resize the window.

Alternatively, click in the window title with the right-hand mouse button and select "Resize" from the menu, then drag the mouse to resize the window.
