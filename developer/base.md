# Working with the FreeBSD base system

In some situations it may be necessary to make changes to existing software that comes in the FreeBSD base system.

This section describes how to make such changes using an example.

## Example

Suppose you would like to make a small change to the source code of software that comes in the FreeBSD base system.

Here is a real-life example on how to do that:

<https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=251025> can be fixed by changing a few lines in

<https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/blob/main/usr.sbin/efivar/efivar.c>

## Installing the FreeBSD source code

Unfortunately one has to download/update the whole FreeBSD source code, even if one just wants to make a change to one command line tool.

From <http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/> (or from whatever FreeBSD version you are using) download {file}`src.txz`. Then:

```console
$ cd /
$ tar xf ~/Downloads/src.txz
$ rm ~/Downloads/src.txz
```

## Building a command line tool without changes

Build the command line tool without changes first to ensure it builds and works as expected.

```console
$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/efivar/
$ make
$ /usr/obj/usr/src/amd64.amd64/usr.sbin/efivar/efivar
```

## Making changes 

Now make changes to the command line tool.

```console
$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/efivar/
$ rm efivar.c
// From https://reviews.freebsd.org/D29620
$ wget "https://reviews.freebsd.org/file/data/yytb47lr5cxaijaaupeh/PHID-FILE-gihl33z7feu4dagjxjgz/usr.sbin_efivar_efivar.c" -O efivar.c
$ make
$ /usr/obj/usr/src/amd64.amd64/usr.sbin/efivar/efivar
```
