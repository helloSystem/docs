# Keyboard

The __Keyboard__ preferences application lets you change the keyboard layout (language) of your attached keyboard, and allows you to set which physical key should act as your ⌘ (command) key. it also lets you disable the Caps Lock key.

``` .. note::
    The keyboard layout (language) gets set automatically during system startup if an official Raspberry Pi keyboard is attached or the system is running on Macintosh hardware, which has the prev-lang:kbd EFI key set.
```

## Setting the keyboard layout

Simply click on a language (keyboard layout). The change is effective immediately.

## Selecting a physical key to act as ⌘ (command)

Swapping the keys will result in the key left from the spacebar to act as the ⌘ (command) key (like switchers from the Mac would expect) and therfore is the default.

__If a PC keyboard is attached__, you can select the "Use the Alt key as ⌘" checkbox. This will swap the __Ctrl__ and __Alt__ keys.

__If an Apple keyboard is attached__, you can select the "Use the ⌘ key for menu shortcuts" checkbox. This will swap the __alt ⌥__ and __cmd ⌘__ keys.

If you prefer the keys not be swapped, simply uncheck the respective checkbox. The change is effective immediately.

## Disabling the Caps Lock key

You can select the "Disable the Caps Lock key" checkbox. This will disable the Caps Lock key. The change is effective immediately.
