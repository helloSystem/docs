# Shortcut Keys

The __Shortcut Keys__ preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts.


``` .. note::
    The left Ctrl and Alt keys are swapped in helloSystem by default to make shortcuts feel welcoming to switchers coming from the Mac.
```

A __shortcut__ is a key or key combination you can press to invoke a defined action on your computer. Shortcuts can be defined by applications (per-application shortcuts), or can affect the whole system (system-wide shortcuts).

``` .. note::
    The Shortcut Keys preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts only, not per-application shortcuts. Some applications contain similar functionality inside the respective application to view and edit per-application keyboard shortcuts.
```

## The ⌘ key

The ⌘ key, also known as Command, is the key left to the spacebar on helloSystem, unless you have configured your system differently.

``` .. note::
    The software may refer to the Command key as "Ctrl". This is a known cosmetic issue.
```
