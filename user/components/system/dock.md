# Dock

The __Dock__ is a quick way to launch the most commonly used applications, and a way to see which applications are running at a glance.

It typically sits at the bottom of the screen.

As of helloSystem 0.8.0, the Dock is not started automatically anymore, but you can run it by double-clicking its icon in /System. You can also put a symlink into /Applications/Autostart if you like, or start it programmatically with `launch Dock`.

## Launching applications

To launch an application, click on it in the Dock.

## Seeing running applications

Running applications are marked with a dot below the application icon in the Dock.

## Keeping applications in the Dock

To keep an application in the Dock even if it is not running, click on its icon in the Dock with the right mouse key, and select "Pin" from the context menu.
