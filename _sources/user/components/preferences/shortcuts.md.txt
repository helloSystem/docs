# Shortcut Keys

:::{note}
The Shortcut Keys preferences application has been removed following the switch to KWin, which comes with `kglobalaccel`. This area still needs work.
:::

The {guilabel}`Shortcut Keys` preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts.


:::{note}
The left {kbd}`Ctrl` and {kbd}`Alt` keys are swapped in helloSystem by default to make shortcuts feel welcoming to switchers coming from the Mac.
:::

A __shortcut__ is a key or key combination you can press to invoke a defined action on your computer. Shortcuts can be defined by applications (per-application shortcuts), or can affect the whole system (system-wide shortcuts).

:::{note}
The Shortcut Keys preferences application lets you view and edit system-wide keyboard shortcuts only, not per-application shortcuts. Some applications contain similar functionality inside the respective application to view and edit per-application keyboard shortcuts.

## The ⌘ key

The {kbd}`⌘` key, also known as __Command__, is the key left to the spacebar on helloSystem, unless you have configured your system differently.

:::{note}
Non-native software may refer to the Command key as "Ctrl". This is a known cosmetic issue.

## Default shortcuts

Open the {guilabel}`Shortcut Keys` preferences application to view the default system-wide shortcuts.

Notable default shortcuts include:

* Press {kbd}`Ctrl` + {kbd}`⌘` + {kbd}`Esc` and click on an application window to __forcefully quit an application__ that is malfunctioning
* Press {kbd}`⌘` + {kbd}`⇧` + {kbd}`3` or the {kbd}`PrtScn` key on your keyboard to __take a screenshot__
