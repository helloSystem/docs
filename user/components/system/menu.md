The menu bar at the top of the screen lets you perform, among others, the following functions:

* Get information about your computer
* Hide and unhide windows
* Launch applications
* Shut down your computer
* Search in application menus
* See date and time

## Getting computer information

Select "About This Computer" from the "System" menu.

## Managing windows

Select "Hide all" to minimize all windows to the Dock.

Select "Unhide all" to get all windows back on screen.

## Launching applications

Select an application from "Applications", "Utilities", or "Preferences" in the "Applications" menu.

A quicker way to launch an application is to press Alt+Space, enter a few characters of the application name, select one of the matches from the list, and press the Enter key.

## Shutting down

To shut down your computer, select "Log Out" from the "System" menu, then click "Shut Down". You can also choose "Restart" if you want to restart your computer, or "Log Out" if you would like to log out of the current graphical session.

## Searching in application menus

Click on "Search" in the menu bar, or press __Alt+Space__. Then enter a few characters of the menu entry you would like to execute, select one of the matches from the list, and press the Enter key. If only one choice remains left as you are typing, the remaining entry automatically gets selected.

## Date and time

Date and time in your current timezone are displayed at the right hand side of the menu bar.
