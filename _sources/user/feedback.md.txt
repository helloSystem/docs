## Discussing ideas and wishlist items

Please check [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello) first, including the [wiki](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/wiki). Feel free to discuss ideas and wishlist items at [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues), but please do keep in mind that in order to achieve the intended goal of simplicity, the team needs to say "no" to most wishlist items that do not further that goal.

## Chat

You can meet other helloSystem users and developers in the `#helloSystem` [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel at `irc.libera.chat`. 

Alternatively, you can join [`#helloSystem:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#helloSystem:matrix.org) from any Matrix client (such as the Element web-based Matrix client). This Matrix channel is bridged to the IRC channel. Joining via Matrix has the advantage that you will see responses that you may have received while you were offline. So after asking a question, you can come back in a day or so to see if there were any responses.

In any case, please stay in the channel for a few days and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers.
